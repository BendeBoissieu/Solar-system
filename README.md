Solar System created with React and ThreeJS.

You can find the result here:

Unforntunatly, I could not show the real size, distances and rotations, the differences between the planets and the sun are too high and we won't see nothing.
I have applied some coefficients so the planets keep the same ratio and reduced the size of the sun by 10.

Each planet is clickable, and display some informaion.
